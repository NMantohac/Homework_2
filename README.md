Description:
  - A simple 'About Me' website layout that incldues semantic HTML tags and a navbar that contains the links to   
    'About/Portfolio/Contact' pages. The website is also a responsive layout for mobile screens, which means that the elements are
    nicely fit in different screens sizes. Update: The portolio page contains images of the homeworks I've done, and when clicked, it 
    would open a link in a new tab of that homework's github repo.
  - The website is done through HTML and CSS code in Visual Studio Code, and utilizing Bootstrap with its components and utilities.
  
 Technologies:
  - Visual Studio Code
  - HTML, CSS
  - Bootstrap
  
  Challenges:
  - It was an overall fun experience developing my first website layout, but it came with some challenges.
  - My first format in HTML through all the HTML documents did not efficiently utilize the Bootstrap's grid system, therefore I had 
    trouble understanding why the card and images were not responsive, as well as spending too much time figuring out Media Queries.
  - I learned where I went wrong through searching around the Internet for a bit and watching a youtube tutorial video, so I can say
    that I'm confident in using the Grid System and Media Queries for a responsive website layout.
  - The only thing that I was still unable to do, despite searching the Internet and typing out different code for 2-3 hours, was making     the image text within an image be responsive to the image, and not the card for my portfolio page.
