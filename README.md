Description:
  - A simple 'About Me' website layout that incldues semantic HTML tags and a navbar that contains the links to 'About/Portfolio/Contact' 
    pages. The website is also a responsive layout for mobile screens, which means that the elements are nicely fit in different screens
    sizes.
  - The website is done through HTML and CSS code in Visual Studio Code, and utilizing Bootstrap with its components and utilities.
  
 Technologies:
  - Visual Studio Code
  - HTML, CSS
  - Bootstrap
  
  Challenges:
    - It was an overall fun experience developing my first website layout, but it came with some challenges.
    - My first format in HTML through all the HTML documents did not efficiently utilize the Bootstrap's grid system, therefore I had 
      trouble understanding why the card and images were not responsive, as well as spending too much time figuring out Media Queries.
    - I learned where I went wrong through searching around the Internet for a bit and watching a youtube tutorial video, so I can say
      that I'm confident in using the Grid System and Media Queries for a responsive website layout.
